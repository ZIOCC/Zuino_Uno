This a 5v Arduino Uno -compatible development board to which we've added two Qwiic ports that are driven at 3.3v via MOSFETs that isolate them from the 5v logic levels of the MCU.

Note: As with all of the Version 1.0 Zio Qwiic boards, this board has been produced with the I2C pull-ups disconnected by default. If there's a significant length of wire between this board and your MCU, you'll need to solder closed the solder jumpers (labeled SDA, 3v3 and SCL) to connect the pull-up resistors to VCC. Additionally, there is also a set of solder jumpers to enable 5v auxilliary pull-up resistors in case the ATMega 238p's internal pull-ups aren't getting the job done.
